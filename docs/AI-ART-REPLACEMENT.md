# AI-made art to replace

Every picture, icon and pattern in Token Studio that was made by the AI (drawn by code the AI wrote, or saved from that code), so the owner can swap each one for their own. Open-licence art (the Kenney sprites and icons, the Openclipart ornaments, the museum paintings, NASA pictures, Poly Haven and ambientCG photos, the game-icons.net ornaments and the Lucide interface icons) is **not** on this list. It is credited in `ASSETS-CREDITS.md` and `docs/frame-studio/CREDITS.md`.

The replacement pack (`token-studio-ai-art.zip`) has:

- **`A-replace-these-files/`**: the AI-made files in `public/`. Make your own version with the **same name, size and format** and send it back. Each one is a straight swap.
- **`B-code-drawn-reference/`**: a 512 px picture of each piece of art that has no file because code draws it as the page runs. Send back a picture (PNG with a see-through background, at least 1024 px) or a Frame Studio design (`.framestudio.json`). The code then changes so the app uses yours. The Frame Studio templates also come as `.framestudio.json` files, so you can open the AI's version in Frame Studio and rework it.

How much each group matters:

- **Artwork** is what people see and pick: frames, decorations, backgrounds, the logo. Replace all of it.
- **Patterns** are procedural looks such as textures, smoke, fire and foliage. They are art too, so replace them if you want everything to be yours.
- **Tools** are geometric primitives and image filters such as a circle shape, a glow or a vignette. They are not really artwork, so keeping them is reasonable. It's your call.

### Files (`A-replace-these-files/public/`)

| ✓ | What | Files | Size and format |
|---|---|---|---|
| [x] | 10 drawn backgrounds ("Drawn" group): forest, dungeon, parchment, night-sky, lava, water, tavern, snow, swamp, desert | `backgrounds/<name>.webp` + `<name>-thumb.webp` | **Done:** replaced by open-licence paintings, a NASA photo and an ambientCG texture (credited in `ASSETS-CREDITS.md`); the "Drawn" group is gone |
| [~] | 8 picture frames: gilded-laurel, iron-rivets, runestone, thorns, dragon-scales, celestial, rope, shield-rim | was `frames/<name>.webp` | **Rebuilt as Frame Studio designs** (listed under Drawn → Crafted; `src/frame-studio/project/pictureFrameTemplates.ts`). The picture files are gone, but the designs were still made by the AI: open one in Frame Studio (New → Token Maker's built-in frames), rework it and send the `.framestudio.json` back |
| [x] | "Try a sample" goblin | now `sample/true-goblin.png` | **Done:** the owner's True Goblin |
| [x] | Favicon (browser-tab icon) | `favicon.svg` | **Done:** the owner's TM ring, also the top-bar logo |

## Made from the art above (redone automatically, not by hand)

These are drawn by scripts from the art above, so they update once the art is replaced:

- `public/help/*.webp`: 209 before/after help pictures. Run `npm run tm:help-images`.
- `docs/frame-studio/screenshots/`: Frame Studio's documentation screenshots. Run `npm run fs:screenshots`. They aren't on the site.
- `e2e/token-maker/fixtures/` (goblin-boss, flat-goblin, purple-ring, the AI cut-out mask) and `scripts/token-maker/make-fixture.ts`: pictures for the tests only. They are never shown to visitors.
- Frame, decoration, effect and preset tiles in the panels: drawn as the page runs.
