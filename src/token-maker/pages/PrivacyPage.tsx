        <strong>In short:</strong> your pictures stay on your device, there are no accounts, no analytics, no cookies
        and no adverts.
      </p>

      <h2>Your pictures</h2>
      <p>
        Pictures you upload, drop or paste are opened and edited in your browser, on your own device. They are never
        sent to our server, and the tokens you make are saved straight from your browser.
      </p>

      <h2>AI background removal</h2>
      <p>
        If you choose AI background removal, your browser downloads the AI model once (about 100 MB) from{' '}
        <a href="https://huggingface.co/studioludens/birefnet-lite-512" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
          Hugging Face
        </a>{' '}
        and the program that runs it from the jsDelivr CDN. Those sites see the download request as usual. The model then
        runs on your device: your picture is never uploaded anywhere.
      </p>

      <h2>Web addresses</h2>
      <p>
        When you paste a link, our small server (running on Cloudflare) fetches that web page or picture for you, because
        most sites don’t let one website read another’s pictures directly. It passes the picture or the list of pictures
        on the page straight back to your browser and keeps no copy. To stop misuse, it counts how many requests come
        from each internet address for one minute, in memory only, and refuses private or local addresses.
      </p>
      <p>
        The small previews of pictures found on a page load straight from that site, just as if you had visited it, so
        that site can see your request as usual.
      </p>

      <h2>What is kept in your browser</h2>
      <p>To save your work, these are kept in your own browser’s storage, on your device only:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the token you are working on (and its pictures), so a refresh doesn’t lose it — <em>New</em> clears it;</li>
        <li>the presets you save, and the frames, fonts and effect or decoration pictures you upload;</li>
        <li>the AI cut-outs made for your pictures, and the AI model itself (in the browser’s cache);</li>
        <li>small settings such as the theme, menu style, panel width, brush size and export choices.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>They never leave your device. Clearing this site’s data in your browser removes them.</p>

      <h2>Hosting</h2>
      <p>
        The site runs on Cloudflare, as a Cloudflare Worker that serves the pages and the small server for web
        addresses. Like any web host, Cloudflare handles the requests your browser makes
        (for example your internet address) to deliver the site and protect it from attacks; see{' '}

        . Token Maker itself adds no tracking.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes</h2>
      <p>
        If anything here changes — for example if adverts or optional accounts are ever added — this page will say so
        first, and anything that needs your permission will ask for it. See <Link href="/about">About</Link> for what
        Token Maker is.
      </p>

      <h2>Terms of use</h2>
      <p>
        Token Studio is free, open-source software, offered under the{' '}

        . By using it you agree that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          you have the rights to every picture you upload or link to, and to use the tokens you make from them (for
          example, your own art, art you have permission to use, or art whose licence allows it);
        </li>
        <li>
          the tool is provided “as is”, without warranty of any kind, and you use it at your own risk — the authors are
